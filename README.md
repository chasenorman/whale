This binary produces the UPE whale in any standard terminal. 

![The Result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chasenorman/whale/master/whale.png)

This image is created using only unicode characters in the terminal's 80x24 grid. The colors are created with ANSI codes. It uses block unicode characters in an ideal configuration to minimize per-pixel error. 

The code is smaller in size than the resultant unicode. This code is free for anyone to use without credit.
